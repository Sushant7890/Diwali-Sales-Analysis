# Diwali-Sales-Analysis
## Introduction
This report provides a detailed analysis of sales data collected during the Diwali festival. The dataset encompasses customer demographics, product details, order information, and sales figures. The primary goal of this analysis is to derive meaningful insights that enhance customer experience and drive revenue growth.

## Data Loading and Cleaning
The dataset, titled "Diwali Sales Data," consists of 11,251 entries across 15 columns, including User ID, Customer Name, Product ID, Gender, Age Group, Age, Marital Status, State, Zone, Occupation, Product Category, Orders, and Amount, along with two unnamed columns.

To ensure data integrity and relevance, the 'Status' and 'unnamed1' columns were removed due to irrelevance or missing values. Additionally, records with null values in the 'Amount' column were eliminated. Data types were standardized, with the 'Amount' column converted to an integer format for consistency in numerical analysis.
